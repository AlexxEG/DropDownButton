# DropDownButton

## Introduction

DropDownButton is a button with a second button on the right side which opens a extended ContextMenuStrip called DropDownMenu.

## Quick Tip

If the Text property is empty, it will display whatever the last clicked item's Text is, and you can click the left button to click the last clicked item. If not it will always display the Text, and only the right button will be click-able.

Also a DropDownMenu can be shared, and the button can be identified by the 'sender' object usually located in event handlers.
